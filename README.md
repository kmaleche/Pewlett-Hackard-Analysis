# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
This project was conducted in order to assist Pewlett Hackard's Human Resources team in preparing for a wave of upcoming retirements. After parsing and analyzing various existing employment datasets, we have created a number of tables that provide key insights like the total number of anticipated vacancies and how each of the company's departments will be affected.

## Results
Our analysis uncovered the following findings:
 - 36619 Pewlett Hackard employees meet the specified reitrement criteria.
 - The departments with the most upcoming retirements are Development (9,281 upcoming-retirees identified) and Production (8,174 upcoming-retirees).
 - The positions that will have the most vacancies are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.
 - There are 1940 employees eligible for the new mentorship program being rolled out by the Slaes and Development teams.

## Conclusion
Based on this analysis, we recommend that Hewlett Packard's HR team focus on recruitment/promotion of Senior-level individuals, particularly Engineers and those in Production and Development, as they prepare for this new wave of retirements.
